    <h1 class="fs-4 fw-bold  ">1) What is the difference between map, filter, find, forEach method</h1>
    <p class="fs-6"><span class="
        fw-bold">map()=></span> Creates a new array with the results of calling a provided
        function on every
        element in the calling array. It returns a new array with the same length as the original array.</p>
    <p class="fs-6"><span class="
        fw-bold">filter()=></span></strong> Creates a new array with all elements that pass the test
        implemented by
        the provided function. It returns a new array with only the elements that satisfy the condition.</p>
    <p class="fs-6"><span class="
        fw-bold">forEach()=></span></strong> Executes a provided function once for each array element. It
        does not
        return anything.</p>
    <p class="fs-6"><span class="
        fw-bold">find()=></span></strong> Returns the value of the first element in the array that
        satisfies the
        provided testing function. It returns undefined if no element satisfies the condition.</p>

    <h1 class="fs-4  fw-bold  ">2) What is the difference between localStorage,
        sessionStorage, and cookies ?
    </h1>
    <p class="fs-6"><span class="
        fw-bold">localStorage:</span> localStorage is a property that allows JavaScript sites and apps to
        save
        key-value pairs in a web browser with no expiration date. This means the data stored in the browser will persist
        even after the browser window is closed.</p>
    <p class="fs-6"><span class="
        fw-bold">Session Storage:</span> Session storage allows you to store data in the browser depending
        on the system memory and the data stored in the browser until the browser is closed.</p>
    <p class="fs-6"><span class="
        fw-bold">cookie:</span> A cookie is a piece of data from a website that is stored within a web
        browser that the website can retrieve at a later time. </p>





    <h1 class="fs-4  fw-bold">3) What is Event Loop? How does it work?</h1>
    <p>Event loop is a loop that continually checks the message queue
        for
        new events and executes them one by one in the order they are received. Each event is processed synchronously,
        meaning that each event must finish executing before the next event in the queue can be processed.

        Events can be added to the message queue from various sources, such as user interactions (like clicking a
        button), network requests, or timer events. When an event is added to the message queue, the event loop checks
        if there is any code currently executing. If there is code executing, the event loop
        waits until the code has finished executing before dequeuing and processing the next event in the queue. </p>

    <h1 class="fs-4  fw-bold  ">4) Function work of quizTimer</h1>

    <p class="fs-6"><span class="
             p-1 fw-bold text-black">quizTimer()=></span> This function, quizTimer, takes one argument,
        dismiss.

        If dismiss is true, the function clears the interval timer and returns.

        If dismiss is not true, the function sets the interval timer to run every second. Within this interval function,
        it calculates the minutes and seconds left in the quiz and displays them in the HTML element with the ID count.
        It also updates the count variable to keep track of the elapsed time.

        If more than 60 seconds have passed, the function alternates between adding and removing classes to change the
        color of the timer display. </p>

        <h1 class="fs-4  fw-bold  ">5) Function work of chooseQuiz</h1>
    <p class="fs-6"><span class="
            fw-bold p-1">chooseQuiz()=></span> This function, chooseQuiz, takes two arguments: an index and
        givenAns.

        It first checks if there is an existing answer in the answers array that matches the ID of the quiz at the given
        index in quizData. If there is, it updates the existing answer with the new givenAns value. If there is no
        existing answer, it creates a new answer object with the quiz information from quizData and the givenAns value,
        and adds it to the answers array.

        Finally, the function calls the displayAnswers function with the updated answers array. </p>
